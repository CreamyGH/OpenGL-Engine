# OpenGL-Engine

**OpenGL-Engine** is my **hobby project** written in **C++ 20** and **OpenGL 4.6** ‚Äì a game engine built with an **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture.  
This project is primarily for **fun, learning, and self-improvement**.  

---

## Features
- Entity Component System (ECS) architecture,
- Backend system already in place ‚Üí future support for multiple graphics APIs,
- Currently supports **OpenGL 4.6**,
- Written in  **C++ 20**,
- Build system powered by **Premake5**.

## Building the Project

### üîπ Windows

**Requirements:**

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (2019 or newer recommended),
* [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/),

**Steps:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenGL-Engine.git
   cd OpenGL-Engine
   ```

2. Run the batch script to generate the Visual Studio project files:

   ```powershell
   GenerateProject.bat
   ```

3. Open the generated `.sln` file in Visual Studio.

4. Build the project (`Debug` or `Release`).

5. Run the compiled executable from the `bin/` directory.

### üîπ Linux

**Requirements:**
- C++ compiler (`g++` or `clang++`),  
- `make`,  
- [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/),

**Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenGL-Engine.git
   cd OpenGL-Engine
   ```

2. Generate Makefiles with Premake5:

   ```bash
   premake5 gmake2
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Run the executable (inside `bin/` folder)

## Project Status

üëâ Right now I‚Äôm working on the **overall rendering architecture**, since the main focus at this stage is building a solid foundation for the engine.

Future goals:

* Scene editor,
* Physics,
* Networking (multiplayer),
* Support for additional graphics APIs (e.g., Vulkan, DirectX),
